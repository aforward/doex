defmodule Doex.Client do
  @moduledoc"""
  Access service functionality through Elixir functions,
  wrapping the underlying HTTP API calls.

  This is where custom code will be created to
  provide convenience methods.

  Most calls will simply help provide more informed
  defaults, as well as possibly reformat the output
  for easier user.

  As there are no client specific calls yet, you should
  look more at direct calls through the API.
